Project #2: Pixel Paint

User Story:
* The user can see an 18x18 grid.
* When the user clicks on one of the boxes in the Grid the color changes.
* Above the grid is a color picker input.
* The user can select a color and when they click on the box the color they selected is what is generated.
* BONUS: Allow the user to decide the size of the grid. The default is 18x18 but they can make it bigger or smaller.
